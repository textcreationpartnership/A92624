            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Much Honored Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>INCE you were pleaſed to command my Thoughts upon the preſent State of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, I ſhall deliver my Senſe with as much brevity as I can: And altho you were pleaſed to Argue for them at a better rate than many of them can for themſelves, yet I cannot reconcile my ſelf wholly to your Sentiments, for the following Reaſons.</p>
            <p>I. For that this great Extenſive Trade, under the conduct it has been of late years, has been managed only to ſerve the ambitious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Two or Three aſpiring Men, without any regard had to the Common Good.</p>
            <p>II. The Diſtreſs and Exigence they have brought on their Affairs at home and abroad, has laid them under a diſability of carrying on the Trade; their Factors writing by a Ship lately arrived, <q>That Poverty and Deſolation reigns throughout all their Factories; That they had been ſo long ſtrangers to Supplies from <hi>England,</hi> that they feared their Maſters had quite forgot them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>III. An Act of Parliament will give ſuch great Advantages to the future Adventurers, that I am morally aſſured, One Thouſand Pounds paid in, upon an Eſtabliſhment by Act of Parliament, would with a moderate ſucceſs of Trade, in Five Years time, be currently ſold for Six Thouſand Pounds; and very probably in a little time after the paſſing ſuch an Act, would ſwell to near half
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:171833:2"/> that vaine: And this Poſition will appear ſo reaſonable to any who are converſant in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, eſpecially now at this time, when all Eaſtern Goods are bought at ſo low Rates in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and ſold at ſuch exceſſive Prizes in all <hi>European</hi> Markets, that the Computation I have made, will be found modeſt to any Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Enquirer.</p>
            <p>From which I infer, that conſidering the Deportment and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the preſent Company, at home and abroad, one would think they ſhould be the laſt Men in the Nation to whom ſuch a Bleſſing ſhould be offered, who have made ſo ill a uſe of their Grants and Charters hitherto.</p>
            <p>IV. A Condemning and Cenſuring, by ſome National Act, the Violence and Depredarions committed on the Subjects of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> by direction of this preſent Company, will tend very much to ſecure the Honour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and will be looked on with a good Eye in the Court of that great Prince. And let the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Adventurers ſay what they pleaſe, ſo long as they continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Reproach and Diſeſteem with the Natives, they can never hope to Trade with that Freedom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Honour, and Security, which a New Company may expect to be careſs'd with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The poor <hi>Indians</hi> will not eaſily lay down their Fears and Jealouſies, but will be under conſtant apprehenſions of meeting again with the ſame Treatment, ſo long as they have to do with the ſame Men.</p>
            <p>To what I have been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ging, 'tis very likely they will reply, That by the Credit of an Act, they can carry on the Trade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without calling in the help of an additional Subſcription. In this they ſay the Truth, but the Argument is ſo frivolous, and has been ſo often expoſed, that I ſhall give it no other anſwer, but that I hope you will oblige them to bring in very good Teſtimonials of the faithful diſcharge of the Truſts hitherto repoſed in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are admitted to put in their Plea to have the preference of ſo Royal a Largeſs as an Act of Parliament, while there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others of their Fellow-Subjects, no doubt as well qualified and deſerving, who are capable of improving it to as good Purpoſes as themſelves.</p>
